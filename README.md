# Postsynaptic Potential Energy as Determinant of Synaptic Plasticity

## Installation & requirements
The current version of the code has been tested with `Python 3.6` on a Windows v10 operating system 
with the Brian2 v2.0.

### Figures 2-4
- The folder 'Model' contains general scripts concerning the biophysical model used in simulations for Figs. 2-4: 
	model morphology, model equations, model parameters, ...
- The folder 'HomoPlastics' contains scripts to generate the necessary data used for Figs. 2 and 3 in the article, 
	using the biophysical neuron model from the 'Model' folder.
- The folder 'HeteroPlastics' contains scripts to generate the necessary data used for Fig. 4 in the article.


### Acknowledgments
- We used the Brian2 neuron simulator in Python based on https://github.com/brian-team/brian2
- The code has been based on ModelDB (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/)
